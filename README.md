# Agentic Proofs

A repository that contains mathematical proofs generated by, or with the aid of, LLMs, as well as any supporting materials and relevant tooling that may be of interest.

Proofs are published here typically in a commit-reveal scheme to provide:

1. Proof of existence at time $T_0$ (commitment)
2. Content unreadable until time $T_1$ (timed release)

This is done in order to help prevent data leakage when certain "timed challenges" are underway, as in [First Proof](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2602.05192).
